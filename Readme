🪨 Sonar Rock vs Mine – Machine Learning Classifier
This project is a binary classification model that uses machine learning to distinguish between sonar signals bounced off metal cylinders (mines) and rocks. It is based on the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📊 Dataset
Source: UCI Sonar Dataset

Features: 60 numerical attributes representing sonar signal energy at different frequencies

Target:

R = Rock

M = Mine

🧠 Model
Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Libraries Used:

pandas for data handling

scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

🔍 Workflow
Load and explore the dataset

Preprocess and split into training/testing sets

Train a logistic regression model

Evaluate accuracy on both sets

Build a prediction system for new inputs

✅ Results
Training Accuracy: ~83.7%

Testing Accuracy: ~85.7%

The model can predict whether a sonar signal is likely from a rock or a mine.

🚀 How to Use
Upload sonar_data.csv to your Colab environment

Run the notebook to train and test the model

Use the prediction cell to classify new sonar readings
